Click on Task
- on Dashboard, expands to show menu:
-- if not complete
[Edit][Complete][Delete][Defer][Reschedule]
-- if complete
[Not complete][Delete]
- on Future, expands to show menu:
[Edit][Delete][Move to (today)][Reschedule]

Move "Add Task" to fab/bottom menu button

On every launch of the app, find all tasks that have been to assigned to a scope that has already passed.
- "Migrate overdue tasks"
-- yesterday
-- last week
- display as task in dashboard?

"Migrate overdue tasks" view should allow
- swipe to complete
- swipe to move to today
- reschedule
- delete

BULK ACTIONS
- hold down item on view, enter bulk edit mode
-- select all button
-- OPTIONS:
--- mark as complete
--- move to "today" or "this week"
--- reschedule
--- delete

New Tab/Feature: Manage
- schedule tasks for this month (low pri)
- schedule tasks for this year (low pri)
- reschedule tasks from last month? (high pri)
- reschedule tasks from last year? (high pri)
- schedule some tasks on the back-burner? (low pri)
* only show 5-7 at a time, allow user to back out at any time
* ways to prioritize/order this list?

(tasks for month/year get automatically moved to current scope?)
(maybe these should be shown as tasks in dashboard with special styling)

Add confirm dialog for deleting task

Eventually: custom select scope mechanism

Add Scope BEFORE or BY(date)
- shows as unscoped (but maybe prioritized in unscoped list)
- also equivalent to the latest scope(s) it could be done in
EX: before October 15th, 2021
shows up in year: 2021?
shows up in month: September 2021 (after the 15th) and October 2021 (before the 15th)?
shows up in week: Oct 10 - Oct 17 2021
shows up in day: Oct 14/Oct 15th

New Tab/Feature: Category
- Set category in edit/create task
New Tab/Feature: Browse (Past, Future, Search)
- Select scope to view?
- what is the best way to browse this?

Edit Add Task:
- Auto-complete tasks based on both currently and previously scheduled tasks
-- Optimizing suggestions

New Feature: Habits/repeating tasks
- Daily, Weekly, Every X Units
- X times per Y Units
-- this may be opening a can of worms
- Can't delete instances, only SKIP
- Two strategies:
-- STATIC
--- if one instance is missed, don't adjust timing of next instance
--- can be marked as complete when migrating tasks (but not deferred/rescheduled)
--- can't reschedule a single instance, only the entire series
-- DYNAMIC
--- if an instance is missed, it is automatically moved to next Scope
--- can be marked as complete and deferred/rescheduled
